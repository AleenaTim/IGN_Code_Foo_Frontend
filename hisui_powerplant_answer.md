**Hisui's New Power Plant**

Requested By: Professor Laventon

The Galaxy Team has decided that in order to advance the research on Pokemon and the Pokedex, Jubilife village needs a brand new power plant. 
Luckily, Professor Laventon has discovered that the Pokemon, Voltorb, is the best candidate to help power the village.
Voltorbs can cleanly and efficiently produce electricity. An average Voltorb is about 0.5m (1'08") tall and weighs 10.4 kg (22.8lbs). 
However, they are uncommon and are only found in the Sacred Plaza.

Objective: How many Voltorbs will you need to catch to fully power the village. Describe each step in your thought process.

**Step 1: Gather given information to solve for missing information:**

*What we know:*
- [x] Thunderbolt is the most efficient move due to high voltage and PP
- [x] Voltorbs can only learn Thunderbolt through TM
- [x] There needs to be a consistent amount of electricity being transferred to power the village
- [x] Assume we are taking average, run-of-the-mill Voltorb(s) and not legendaries, pseudo-legendaries or mythicals
- [x] Assume electricity potential is based on the type of electric moves (for example: discharge, thunder punch, electro ball, thunderbolt)
- [x] The best move that would generate electricity efficiently without burning or wrecking the power plant would be Thunderbolt
- According to the show, thunderbolt only causes paralysis or loss of consciousness 
- When Pikachu uses thunderbolt, it generates 100,000 volts of electricity (we can use Pikachu as a reference since its frame and stats are closely 
  similar to a Voltorb)
- Since figuring out the current is equally important, let's assume the ratio of natural lightningâ€™s voltage to a Pokemon's thunderbolt voltage is 
  the same value as the current. Natural lightning is 3M volts and 30kAmps. Thunderbolt has a voltage of 100kV, a current of 10Amps, resulting in a 
  power of 1MW  
- [x] 1MW = 1000KW

**Step 2: Some math to get an estimated measurement:**
- [ ] How much electricity does it take to fully power Jubilife village?
      - On average, it takes around 1.8KW to fully power a village. If we were to consider the lack of electricity usage in Jubilife's village sublocations,
        it would take way less electricity but we will use 1.8KW as our baseline
      - Need to calculate the ratio to find how many MW it takes to fully power the village: (1MW/1000KW) = (x/1.8KW) => x = 0.0018MW
- [ ] 


**Step 3: Final Result (w/ different solutions):**

**Step 4: Consider possibilities/risks:**
- For the sake of redundancy, in case one or more of the Voltorbs is unusable for whatever reason (out of PP, got KO'd by another Voltorb, "accidentally" 
self-destruct or escaped), we can have at most 24 Voltorbs and each individual Voltorb will alternate for 1 hour of the day giving the other Voltorbs a 
chance to recover and have their own free time as well (because we are a humane society of pokemon trainers/researchers).
- Batteries can be effective at containing electricity in case of emergencies
- Risk of Voltorbs self-destructing randomly so they need careful and extreme supervision
