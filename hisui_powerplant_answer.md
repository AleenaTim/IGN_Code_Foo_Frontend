2. Hisui's New Power Plant
Requested By: Professor Laventon

The Galaxy Team has decided that in order to advance the research on Pokemon and the Pokedex, Jubilife village needs a brand new power plant. 
Luckily, Professor Laventon has discovered that the Pokemon, Voltorb, is the best candidate to help power the village.
Voltorbs can cleanly and efficiently produce electricity. An average Voltorb is about 0.5m (1'08") tall and weighs 10.4 kg (22.8lbs). 
However, they are uncommon and are only found in the Sacred Plaza.

Objective: How many Voltorbs will you need to catch to fully power the village. Describe each step in your thought process.

Step 1: Gather given information and missing information:
Given

Step 4: Consider possibilities
For the sake of redundancy, in case one or more of the Voltorbs is unusable for whatever reason (out of PP, got KO'd by another Voltorb or escaped), 
we can have at most 24 Voltorbs for each hour of the day giving Voltorbs a chance to recover and have it's own free time as well.
