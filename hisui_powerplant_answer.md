**Hisui's New Power Plant**

Requested By: Professor Laventon

The Galaxy Team has decided that in order to advance the research on Pokemon and the Pokedex, Jubilife village needs a brand new power plant. 
Luckily, Professor Laventon has discovered that the Pokemon, Voltorb, is the best candidate to help power the village.
Voltorbs can cleanly and efficiently produce electricity. An average Voltorb is about 0.5m (1'08") tall and weighs 10.4 kg (22.8lbs). 
However, they are uncommon and are only found in the Sacred Plaza.

Objective: How many Voltorbs will you need to catch to fully power the village. Describe each step in your thought process.

Step 1: Gather given information to solve for missing information:

*What we know:*
- [x] Thunderbolt is the most efficient move due to high voltage and PP
- [x] Voltorbs can only learn Thunderbolt through TM
- [x] There needs to be a consistent amount of electricity being transferred to power the village
- [x] Assume we are taking average Voltorb(s)
- [ ] Assume electricity potential is based 

*What needs to be solved:*
- [ ] How much electricity does Thunderbolt produce?
- [ ] How much electricity does it take to power Jubilife village for a day?

Step 2: Some math to get an accurate measurement:

Step 3: Final Result:

Step 4: Consider possibilities/risks:
- For the sake of redundancy, in case one or more of the Voltorbs is unusable for whatever reason (out of PP, got KO'd by another Voltorb, "accidentally" 
self-destruct or escaped), we can have at most 24 Voltorbs and each individual Voltorb will alternate for 1 hour of the day giving the other Voltorbs a 
chance to recover and have their own free time as well (because we are a humane society of pokemon trainers/researchers).
- Batteries can be effective at containing electricity in case of emergencies
- Risk of Voltorbs self-destructing randomly so they need careful and extreme supervision
-
