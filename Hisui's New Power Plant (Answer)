2. Hisui's New Power Plant
Requested By: Professor Laventon
The Galaxy Team has decided that in order to advance the research on Pokemon and the Pokedex, Jubilife village needs a brand new power plant. Luckily, Professor Laventon has discovered that the Pokemon, Voltorb, is the best candidate to help power the village.
Voltorbs can cleanly and efficiently produce electricity. An average Voltorb is about 0.5m (1'08") tall and weighs 10.4 kg (22.8lbs). However, they are uncommon and are only found in the Sacred Plaza.
Objective: How many Voltorbs will you need to catch to fully power the village. Describe each step in your thought process.
